### Progress

* The basic functionality is complete, but I am still a bit confused about the part where we parse with an array to enable our numbers to be cut by comma's.
* I want to do some extra styling and fix the default display box size so it stays the same
* Some additional functions that allow me to play a bit with understanding the code behind everything
